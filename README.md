ABOUT 
  </h2>
  <p>
This program is a Task Manager I created in Python.
  </p>
<p>
When the program is initialised, the user is asked to enter their login details. 

  These login details are taken from a text file called user.txt and once the username and password have been entered correctly, the user will be presented with a menu.
  
  This menu will change depending on wether it is an Admin logged in or just a regular user. 
  
  Functions will run depending on what menu choice the user picks.
  
  The menu options are as follows:
  - Register a new user (Allows you to create a username and password and store it in the text file).
  - Assign tasks to users.
  - View all tasks for all users.
  - View your tasks and mark it as complete or edit the date if it is incomplete
  - Generate a report which will create 2 text files which are user_summary and task_summary.
  - Display Statistics which will display the reports generated above.
  - Exit the program.

HOW TO USE 
  </h2>
  
  To use this program, just fork this repository to your local machine so you have all of the text files and Python file.

<p>If you just have the Python file, make sure you create a user.txt file in the same directory so that the program can check and save login details.</p>
